I would think this program will compile but it increases the chance of
failure thru the design choice that is stated. 

The compiler will create a class when it sees the template. so it would need
access to the implementation of the template as well. In a large scale problem,
during the compilation, the linker needs to go through many files and might
miss the template implementation when you want to use it (SINCE you did NOT 
include the implementaiton in the template header file) thus it can throw 
an error.

    I believe that the compiler will be able to create the outline of the class
    and how the class would "Look"overall, however it will fail to bring in 
    the implementation since the linker could not provide it to the compiler.
