1.
    * types need to be able to convert implicitly between each other
    * They need to be passed in by reference to reduce cost
    * All the params have to be of the same CordinateType
    * They all are consts

2.
    * You must create the new template for the copy cons
    * you must pass it by reference (infinite recursion possiblity)

3.
    * new template different than the main template is needed
    * similiar to copy cons

4.
    * They all need to be of the same type with the template name
    * they are all private
    * to access them you need to implement a getter to use them in other 
      templates

5.
    * There needs to be either an implicit or a legal explicit call to the
      parameters in order to return the apprporiate results
